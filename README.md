# multiprocessing project
Implemationtmultipro in the picam.

In Bolivia there is a huge problem regarding Road culture, this project intends to solve this problem with the use of Artificial Inteliligence and Internet of things devices

In this repository we develop a method for getting a high resolution video with high frames per second. Focusing on the interest features like Licence Plates and deciding if a Traffic light is in Red Light and if a Car happens to go cross the red light breaking the current laws
